# C-Shunting-Yard
This is an implementation of the Shunting Yard algorithm in C++. It can solve any simple expression.
This program demonstrates use of:
-Lists
-Stacks
-Regular Expressions
-Maps

This algorithm uses the Reverse Polish Notation system which allows the program to easily evaluate any expression regardless of length of expression.
This project was made for me to practice learning C++, which took me less than a week. This was made in my first month of my freshman year during my bachelors program.
